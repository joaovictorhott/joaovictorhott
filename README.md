# 👋 Hi, I’m João Victor

I am a Chemical Engineering student with a background in Industrial Chemistry and hands-on experience in the steel industry, working at the intersection of industrial processes, data, and technology. I have experience supporting steelmaking and raw material processes, quality routines, and technical analysis in highly demanding industrial environments.

I am particularly interested in data-driven decision-making, process optimization, quality, sustainability, and industrial automation, applying programming and analytical thinking to real industrial challenges.

My goal is to use engineering fundamentals, data analysis, and programming to improve processes, support technical decisions, and generate measurable industrial impact.
